= modules under exec stanzas

Executable grammar:

(executable
 (name <name>)
 <optional-fields>)

"<name> is a module name that contains the executableâ€™s main entry point. There can be additional modules in the current directory; you only need to specify the entry point."


Executables: same but plural.

"(names <names>) where <names> is a list of entry point names. Compare with executable, where you only need to specify the modules containing the entry point of each executable.

(public_names <names>) describes under what name to install each executable. "


Inferences:

* dir must contain the module(s) srcs named in the name (names) field.
* it may contain additional module srcs. The docs do not specify how
  they are interpreted, but dune seems to treat them as deps of the
  entry point, or at any rate as what OBazl calls the "prologue" of
  the executable - modules to be linked before the ep.

So in the absence of a (modules) list, mibl encodes the ep as (:main . <name>), and the remaining modules as (:prologue <list>)

A further assumption:  flags etc. specified on the executable(s) stanza apply to all the prologue modules.


Scenarios:

Singletons, may be expressed using either (executable) or (executables).  Realworld code often uses (executables) with a single name.

A.  One main.ml
B.  One main.ml with main.mli

In both cases, we may have additional srcs, .ml and .mli.

Multiples:  may be expressed using multiple (executable) stanzas or one (executables) stanza.

WARNING: docs do not say how (modules) is to be interpreted in an
(executables) stanza, so evidently all execs in such a stanza will
have the same prologue. In particular, in the absense of (modules) the
prologue contains everything?

Case: multiple executables with different prologues.  Must use multiple (executable or singleton executables) stanzas each with (modules)
