;; progn used to force build of deps?

;; Evidently such an alias is used to verify that a set of targets
;; build successfully? In Tezos at least, alias 'buildtest' is used in
;; rules that depend on .exe files and that run (progn). In the
;; Makefile, target 'build-test' runs '@dune build @buildtest'.

;; We use rule 'build_test' from the Skylib library for this. Instead
;; of emitting on for each such stanza we iterate over all stanzas
;; aliased to 'foo' and then emit one build-test target.
